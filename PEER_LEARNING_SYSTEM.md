## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Peer Matching

**Compatibility Algorithm:**
```javascript

const techMatchCount = courseTechnologies.filter(tech => 
  userTechnologies.includes(tech) && peerTechnologies.includes(tech)
).length;

// Progress Similarity (30% weight)
const progressDifference = Math.abs(userCompletedLevels - peerCompletedLevels);
if (progressDifference <= 3) { // Similar progress within 3 levels
  compatibilityScore += Math.max(0, 30 - (progressDifference * 5));
}

// Course Engagement (20% weight)
const timeRatio = Math.min(userTotalTime, peerTotalTime) / Math.max(userTotalTime, peerTotalTime);
compatibilityScore += timeRatio * 20;

// Online Activity (10% weight)
const daysSinceLastActivity = (Date.now() - new Date(lastActivity)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
if (daysSinceLastActivity <= 7) {
  compatibilityScore += Math.max(0, 10 - daysSinceLastActivity);
