## App Context: **UpTogether**

**Tagline**: *A platform to learn, build, and get hired together.*

---

### Problem Statement

Many learners face three key challenges early in their journey:

1. **Hesitation to Ask for Help**: Fear of judgment from seniors often stops them from asking questions.
2. **Lack of Motivation and Consistency**: Self-paced learning often fails due to poor follow-through.
3. **Minimal Real-World Exposure**: There's a gap between academic learning and industry-level project experience.

### Proposed Solution

A collaborative learning platform that offers:

* **Solo or Collaborative Learning**: Learn independently or connect with peers or mentors learning the same topic.
* **Project Collaboration**: Complete real-world projects with others to build hands-on experience.
* **Portfolio Building**: Showcase completed courses and projects in a structured, verifiable portfolio.
* **Job Recommendations**: Match users with job opportunities based on their skills and portfolio.
* **Company Validation**: Employers can verify the authenticity of a user's learning and project claims directly from the platform.

### Motivation

The team faced similar struggles at the start of their own learning journeys and saw a gap:

> "Is there any platform that tells me if someone else is learning the same thing and can collaborate?"

Current platforms only partially solve these issues. **UpTogether** aims to address all of them in a single ecosystem.
